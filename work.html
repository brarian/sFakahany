      Below is an excerpt of Walking With The Ultimate Rebel: An Ethnographic
      Study of Hipster Christianity, an ethnography I completed in 2018. Hipster
      Christianity, to me, was the inevitable collision of our youth-oriented
      culture, the rise of social media, and an established institution’s fear
      of losing relevancy. To learn more about the subculture of Christian
      hipsters, I infiltrated a chapter of Hillsong, a megachurch known for its
      popularity amongst celebrities.
    </aside>
    <hr />
    <main>
      <p>
        Could millennials find the authentic, caring communities they crave by
        embracing hipster Christendom? Did tattooing a Station of the Cross on
        your wrist help or hinder your relationship with others? I wasn’t sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out, I decided to attend six services at Hillsong Connecticut, a
        division of Hillsong NYC. Hillsong, an influential “church franchise”
        based in Australia is, according to Cosmopolitan, “the latest
        celeb-adjacent religion since Kabbalah”. Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber
        worship at the Hammerstein Ballroom location in New York, and their
        strobe-lit, fog-machine laden worship services “rival any other
        contemporary form of entertainment.” I chose to worship at their
        Greenwich location, based at the Greenwich Baptist Church, in order to
        better observe and interact with the church leaders and congregation.
        Because this chapter of Hillsong only offered Wednesday worship, I went
        six weeks in a row to a service at 7:30 PM. I took field notes in the
        pews during the “message” part of each service, and chatted with church
        members both in the vestibule before and after worship, and during
        “group hangs” at Glory Days, a 24-hour diner in Greenwich. Though I
        would have explained the reason behind my research if anyone had asked,
        no one did: many people were happy to talk about why and how they chose
        to attend this particular Hillsong chapter. During my first interaction
        with each member, I asked the same three questions: What is your name?,
        Is it your first time?, and Are you from the area? With the intention of
        better understanding the church’s motivations and aims, I also conducted
        a multimodal critical discourse analysis of the Hillsong literature I
        received at worship: this consisted a brochure detailing the church’s
        annual Colour Conference, another brochure concerning the 2018 Hillsong
        Conference, and a “Bible Magazine” given to me by the church’s Info Bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the deluge of articles published about Hillsong NYC, their
        baptisms at the Gaanesvort Hotel’s rooftop pool, and their “on-fleek”
        congregation, I couldn’t help but wonder why they chose to open a
        chapter in Greenwich, Connecticut. Because Greenwich is not hip. And,
        even more scandalous in the eyes of cool, Greenwich has no desire to be
        hip. It is tried, true, and traditional, with a reassuring acreage of
        blue blazers and pastel pants and a smattering of historic Episcopalian
        and Presbyterian churches. Even more surprisingly, the services were
        held not inside an abandoned warehouse or at a convention center but at
        the Greenwich Baptist Church, a red-brick, vine-covered building off the
        main road, across the street from the public middle school.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sorry I’m late,” I whispered to the petite, wizened woman standing near
        the door. “Oh, don’t you worry! Is it your first time?” I nodded, and
        her eyes lighted with missionary zeal. “Come with me,” she said, leading
        me down the aisle to a seat near the front. “Enjoy!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly a dozen people were standing on a small stage bathed in purple
        light, holding microphones or guitars, pounding keyboards or drums. The
        crowd, arms outstretched, swayed along with the music; song lyrics
        flickered across a projection screen the size of a chalkboard. The
        lyrics, strangely enough, did not mention God or Jesus by name at all. I
        wrote down a snippet of the chorus:
      </p>
      <p class="song">
        The time is up for chasing shadows <br />
        You gave the world a light to follow<br />
        A hope that shines beyond tomorrow <br />
        Your love goes on <br />
        Your love goes on
      </p>
      <p>
        The song ends, and a youthful-looking man wearing a woolen beanie and
        tight, black skinny jeans bounds up the aisle to the altar. The front
        row, made up mostly of men in Grizzly Adams flannels, jumped to their
        feet, clapping and whooping: “YEAH!” “Let’s do this!” Taking his
        position in front of the band, the man, grinning, calls out to the room
        at large: “How are y’all doing tonight?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “EEEEEEEEE!” The pew behind me shrieks. Two pews over, a woman bows her
        head and raises her hands above her body, as if she’s clearing the
        runway for God to land: “Yes, Jesus!” The room erupts, and I remind
        myself that I’m at an Evangelical worship service. At a Baptist church.
        In Greenwich, Connecticut. On a Wednesday night.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take my seat for the sermon, and the pastor, with a delivery that’s
        part Southern Baptist fire-and-brimstone and part life coach, tells us
        that now is the time to start a relationship with Jesus, even amid
        stress, new jobs, moves, and other difficult transitions. Pacing up and
        down the aisle, he tells us, microphone in hand, how he and his wife,
        Desiree, “Erin Brockovich-ed” New York City. When he and Des moved from
        Nashville to the Meatpacking District in 2011, they struggled to adjust
        to their new neighborhood. The hardest adjustment they had to make,
        however, was tuning out the wall-shaking, late-night disco music from
        the 24-hour diner immediately below their apartment. They prayed to God
        for guidance, slammed on the floor with a broom, and even talked to the
        diner owner, who refused to turn down the music, and the landlord, who
        laughed in their faces. They finally decided to take on the landlord,
        Erin Brockovich style.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I took out a New York City landlord in three months because I chose to
        do something about it!” the pastor bellowed. “When you choose to give
        your life to Jesus, you aren’t going to wait for the world to change—no
        thanks, John Mayer!” He jumps back on stage, hitting his stride, and
        tells us with fervor about how Antique Roadshow is the greatest show
        ever. Wait, what? “It’s the greatest show ever because people can’t stop
        showing up!” He begins pacing across the stage:
      </p>
      <p class="sermon">
        The appraisers can’t keep their pants on when these people, these, you
        know, these rednecks, drag out these priceless dust-covered heirlooms
        that have been in their families for generations. They’re like ‘Sir, do
        you know what this means? This is worth 50 bazillion dollars. Your
        family… future generations will never have to work. And this guy will be
        like, ‘Oh, this ol’ thing? It’s been in the attic since I was little!’
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral of this story, he tells us, is that we have something
        extremely valuable we aren’t taking advantage of: “Y’all have the full
        authority of Heaven working in and through you, so do something about
        it!”
